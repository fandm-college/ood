# Overview

OpenOnDemand (hence OOD) is the web portal to access the F&M research cluster.
Using OOD you can

- Create, edit, and submit compute jobs
- View the status of the cluster (e.g. see what resources are in use, how many jobs are running)
- Transfer files to/from the cluster (with some limitations)
- Run interactive applications (i.e. applications requiring a GUI)

# Accessing OOD

The OOD web portal can be accessed via this [link](https://rcs-scsn.fandm.edu)

Use your F&M netID and password (the same ones you use to access your F&M Google mail)
to login.
